# Welcome!

This repository provides resources for training OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with your own data.  
All processing and models stay on your local machine, making it suitable for sensitive domains such as medical data.

## Structure

- **Finetuning/** – Instructions and scripts for fine-tuning Whisper on your dataset.  
- **Transcribing/** – Instructions and scripts for using your trained model (or base models) to transcribe audio.

Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` with detailed setup and usage steps!

Thanks!
